### Section 4: Deploy First Application (Django)

#### Objective
To guide participants through the process of deploying a Django application on a Kubernetes cluster, emphasizing the practical application of Kubernetes concepts in a real-world scenario.

#### Background Knowledge
Participants should have familiarity with Python and the Django framework, along with a basic understanding of Docker and containerization. Knowledge of how to create a Dockerfile and build a Docker image is essential. Additionally, a foundational grasp of Kubernetes concepts and YAML syntax will be beneficial.

#### Theories
This section delves into the practicalities of deploying a Django application in a Kubernetes environment. Key concepts include:

1. **Containerization of Django Application**: Containerizing the Django application involves creating a Docker image. This image packages the Django app with all necessary dependencies, making it portable and ready for deployment in Kubernetes.

2. **Kubernetes Deployments and Services**: A Kubernetes Deployment manages stateless applications like Django. It ensures that a specified number of pod replicas, running the application, are operational. A Kubernetes Service, on the other hand, provides an abstract way to expose the application running on a set of Pods as a network service.

3. **Persistent Data and Databases**: Since pods are ephemeral, Kubernetes uses PersistentVolumes (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC) for data persistence. Understanding how to configure these for a database like PostgreSQL, commonly used with Django, is crucial.

4. **ConfigMaps and Secrets**: For managing application configurations and sensitive information, Kubernetes offers ConfigMaps and Secrets. ConfigMaps are used to store non-confidential data in key-value pairs, while Secrets are used for storing sensitive information.

#### Example Code
1. **Dockerizing Django**:
   ```Dockerfile
   # Dockerfile
   FROM python:3.8
   ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1
   RUN mkdir /app
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY requirements.txt /app/
   RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
   COPY . /app/
   ```

2. **Kubernetes Deployment and Service**:
   ```yaml
   # deployment.yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: django-deployment
   spec:
     replicas: 2
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: django
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: django
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: django
           image: <your-docker-image>
           ports:
           - containerPort: 8000
   ---
   # service.yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: django-service
   spec:
     type: LoadBalancer
     ports:
     - port: 8000
     selector:
       app: django
   ```

3. **PersistentVolumeClaim for PostgreSQL**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
   metadata:
     name: postgres-pvc
   spec:
     accessModes:
     - ReadWriteOnce
     resources:
       requests:
         storage: 10Gi
   ```

4. **ConfigMap for Django Settings**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ConfigMap
   metadata:
     name: django-config
   data:
     DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE: "mysite.settings"
   ```

#### Expected Results
Participants will successfully deploy a Django application on their Kubernetes cluster. This deployment will include:

- A containerized Django application running in a Kubernetes Deployment.
- Exposing the application via a Kubernetes Service.
- Configuring persistent storage for the database.
- Utilizing ConfigMaps and Secrets for configuration and sensitive data management.

This hands-on experience will solidify the participants' understanding of deploying web applications in Kubernetes, illustrating the process from containerization to deployment and service exposure.
