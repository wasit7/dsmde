### Section 7: Kubernetes Demo Project Along with Helm

#### Objective
The objective of this section is to provide participants with a comprehensive, hands-on experience in deploying and managing a full-fledged Django application stack on Kubernetes using Helm. This project will incorporate elements from previous sections, such as deploying Django with PostgreSQL, Redis, and Nginx, and managing it all efficiently using Helm.

#### Background Knowledge
Participants should be comfortable with the fundamentals of Kubernetes, including creating and managing Deployments, Services, and PersistentVolumeClaims. They should also have a basic understanding of Helm, as covered in the previous section, and be familiar with the components of the Django application stack (Django-app, PostgreSQL, Nginx, and Redis).

#### Theories
This section focuses on applying the theoretical knowledge and skills acquired in the previous sections to a real-world-like project. It includes:

1. **Project Planning and Design**: Understanding the architecture of the full application stack and how the components interact within the Kubernetes ecosystem.

2. **Helm Chart Development**: Developing a Helm chart for the entire application stack, which will include templates for each component of the stack (Django-app, PostgreSQL, Redis, Nginx).

3. **Configuration Management**: Utilizing Helmâ€™s templating features to manage configurations for different environments (development, staging, production).

4. **Persistent Data Management**: Implementing persistent storage for stateful components like PostgreSQL, ensuring data persistence across pod restarts.

5. **Networking and Service Exposure**: Configuring Ingress and Services for appropriate network routing and external access to the application.

#### Example Code
Building upon the Helm chart from the previous section, participants will expand it to include all components of the Django stack.

1. **PostgreSQL Deployment Template (templates/postgres-deployment.yaml)**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: {{ .Values.postgres.name }}
   spec:
     ...
     containers:
     - name: postgres
       image: {{ .Values.postgres.image }}
       volumeMounts:
       - name: postgres-storage
         mountPath: /var/lib/postgresql/data
   ```

2. **Redis Deployment Template (templates/redis-deployment.yaml)**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: {{ .Values.redis.name }}
   spec:
     ...
     containers:
     - name: redis
       image: {{ .Values.redis.image }}
   ```

3. **Nginx Deployment and Service Template (templates/nginx.yaml)**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: {{ .Values.nginx.name }}
   spec:
     ...
     containers:
     - name: nginx
       image: {{ .Values.nginx.image }}
   ---
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: {{ .Values.nginx.name }}
   spec:
     ...
   ```

#### Expected Results
By the end of this section, participants will be able to:

- Plan and execute a complex deployment of a Django application stack on Kubernetes.
- Develop and utilize a comprehensive Helm chart that encapsulates the Django application, PostgreSQL database, Redis cache, and Nginx web server.
- Understand and implement best practices for managing configurations, persistent data, and networking in Kubernetes.
- Gain practical experience in deploying and managing a multi-component application in a real-world scenario, reinforcing their understanding of Kubernetes and Helm.

This hands-on project will solidify the participants' skills in Kubernetes and Helm, preparing them for real-world application deployments and management challenges.
