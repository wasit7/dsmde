### Course Description
This comprehensive one-day workshop is designed to equip developers with the knowledge and skills required to deploy and manage applications effectively using Kubernetes. The course covers fundamental Kubernetes concepts, practical application deployment with a focus on a Django application stack, and advanced deployment strategies using Helm. It also introduces LENS, a Kubernetes Integrated Development Environment (IDE), to enhance cluster management. By the end of the workshop, participants will have hands-on experience in deploying a multi-component Django application, scaling and updating applications, and managing Kubernetes clusters more efficiently.

### Course Objectives
- **Understand the Core Concepts of Kubernetes**: Gain a clear understanding of Kubernetes architecture, including Pods, Deployments, Services, and more.
- **Set Up a Local Kubernetes Environment**: Learn how to establish and manage a local Kubernetes cluster using tools like K3s.
- **Master Kubernetes Commands**: Become proficient in using `kubectl` to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.
- **Deploy a Django Application on Kubernetes**: Deploy and manage a Django application, integrating components like PostgreSQL, Nginx, and Redis.
- **Implement Scaling and Updating Strategies**: Understand and apply methods for scaling applications and performing zero-downtime updates.
- **Utilize Helm for Application Management**: Learn to use Helm for streamlined deployment and management of Kubernetes applications.
- **Execute a Real-World Project with Helm**: Apply the concepts learned in a practical project, deploying a complete Django application stack using Helm.
- **Explore LENS as a Kubernetes IDE**: Discover how to use LENS for enhanced Kubernetes cluster and application management.
