### Section 1: Kubernetes Concepts

#### Objective
The primary objective of this section is to familiarize participants with the fundamental concepts and components of Kubernetes. By the end of this section, participants should be able to understand and articulate the purpose and functionality of various Kubernetes objects, including Pods, Deployments, StatefulSets, Services, Ingress, Secrets, ConfigMaps, and Jobs.

#### Background Knowledge
Participants should have a basic understanding of containerization technologies like Docker. This includes knowledge of how to containerize an application, the purpose of containerization, and the basics of how containers are deployed and managed. A general understanding of cloud computing and microservices architecture will also be beneficial but not essential.

#### Theories
Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers. It has become the de facto standard for managing containerized applications across various environments, from physical data centers to public and private clouds. Hereâ€™s an overview of the key concepts:

- **Pods**: The smallest and simplest Kubernetes objects. A Pod represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster and can contain one or more containers.
- **Deployments**: Provide a declarative way to manage Pods. They allow you to describe the desired state of your application, and Kubernetes works to maintain this state.
- **StatefulSets**: Used for applications that require persistent storage or unique network identifiers. They manage the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods and provide guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods.
- **Services**: An abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service. Kubernetes gives Pods their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods and can load-balance across them.
- **Ingress**: Manages external access to the services in a cluster, typically HTTP. Ingress may provide load balancing, SSL termination, and name-based virtual hosting.
- **Secrets and ConfigMaps**: Secrets let you store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and ssh keys. ConfigMaps allow you to decouple configuration artifacts from image content to keep containerized applications portable.
- **Jobs**: Create one or more Pods and ensure that a specified number of them successfully terminate as they run to completion.

#### Example Code
While this section is primarily theoretical, some basic `kubectl` commands can be introduced to show these concepts in action:

```bash
# Get information about different Kubernetes objects
kubectl get pods
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get services

# Create a new Deployment
kubectl create deployment hello-world --image=gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0

# Expose the Deployment as a Service
kubectl expose deployment hello-world --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080
```

#### Expected Results
After completing this section, participants will have a clear understanding of the core components of Kubernetes. They should be able to identify what roles Pods, Deployments, StatefulSets, Services, Ingress, Secrets, ConfigMaps, and Jobs play in a Kubernetes environment. This foundational knowledge is crucial for understanding how Kubernetes manages containerized applications and how it can be used to build and deploy scalable, resilient applications. Participants will also gain hands-on experience with basic Kubernetes commands, setting the stage for more advanced interactions in subsequent sections of the workshop.
